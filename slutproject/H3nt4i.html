                  <p>Hentai is a word of Japanese origin which entered usage in Meiji era scientific and psychological journals. While it literally means a change of appearance or strange condition, its association with perversion stems from popular sexology. With the sexualization of Japan, a renewed interest in perverse publications led to normalization of the word in everyday life. The term entered English usage in the 1990s, as a catch-all term to describe erotic anime and manga pornography. Due to its ambiguous and broad attribution, the hentai genre is often superseded by the classification and categorization of specific themes and acts into sub-genres. -Freebase</p>

                <p class="shonen-text">When Kanzaki gets his first love note from a cute girl in another class, he's not sure what will happen. But the last thing he expects when he goes to meet his admirer is to get kicked in the face before he even says hello. It turns out that his admirer, Mari Setagoya, is a vampire and not a very good one, at that. After knocking Kanzaki out and trying to suck up his blood Mari admits that she can't handle the raw taste of blood very well. But she needs to drink life energy to survive, and one bodily fluid is as good as the next when it comes down to it. Kanzaki is all-too willing to oblige, but Mari has another secret. Along with a thirst for life energy and impressive leathery wings, Mari has another special ability, one which is about to awaken thanks to Kanzaki. (imdb 2014)</p>
